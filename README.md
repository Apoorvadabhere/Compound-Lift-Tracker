# Compound Lift Tracker

This is a GUI used to track progress at the gym. It is pretty simple as it record the Max Weight for a particular workout, the reps of that particular set where the 'Max Weight' occurred as well as the date.

The GUI uses Tkinter and SQLite3 to interact with the database. 

As soon at the code is run, a GUI should appear and a .db file (named: Gym) will be created in the same directory as this code.

To open the .db file, you must have a database browser installed! I used [DB Browser](http://sqlitebrowser.org/).
